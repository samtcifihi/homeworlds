# Homeworlds
My attempt to implement the game of Homeworlds developed by John Cooper.

More information available on the site of the creators of Looney Pyramids: https://www.looneylabs.com/rules/homeworlds

# Disclaimer
Unless later noted otherwise here, this is a personal project to work on my programming skills and will thus be inferior to other implementations of this game and this readme might not get updated again, like, ever. So in other words, no warranty express or implied and all that.
